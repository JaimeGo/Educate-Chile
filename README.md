The purpose of the app is to teach school teachers to implement new approaches to further innovation in education. It was used as a starting point for the development of the corresponding area of the existing platform Educar Chile (http://www.educarchile.cl/) which features numerous resources for teachers across Chile.

It also supports standard functionality like registration and login, notifications, etc.
